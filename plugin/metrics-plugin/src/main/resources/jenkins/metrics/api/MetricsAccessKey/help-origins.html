            either http or https
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>*.acme.com</code> - will accept requests from any acme.com server
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>http*:foo.acme.com</code> - will accept http or https requests only from acme.com on any port
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>foo.acme.com:8443</code> - will accept requests in any protocol from foo.acme.com only on port 8443
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>*</code> - will accept requests from any origin.
