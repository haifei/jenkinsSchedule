<div>
    Specifies where Jenkins will store build records on the file system. This
    includes the console output and other metadata generated by a build.
    <p>
    This value may include the following variables:
    <ul>
        <li><tt>${JENKINS_HOME}</tt> &mdash; Absolute path of the Jenkins home
            directory
        <li><tt>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}</tt> &mdash; Absolute path of the directory
            where Jenkins stores the configuration and related metadata for a
            given job
        <li><tt>${ITEM_FULL_NAME}</tt> &mdash; The full name of a given job,
            which may be slash-separated, e.g. <tt>foo/bar</tt> for the job
            <tt>bar</tt> in folder <tt>foo</tt>
    </ul>
    The value must include <tt>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}</tt> or
    <tt>${ITEM_FULL_NAME}</tt>, so that each job can store its build records
    separately.
    <p>
    Changing this value allows you to store build records on a larger, but
    slower disk, rather than on the same disk where builds are executed.
    <p>
    Any changes to this value will take effect as soon as this configuration
    page is saved, but note that Jenkins will not automatically migrate any data
    from the current build record root directory.
    <p>
    The default value is <tt>${ITEM_ROOTDIR}/builds</tt>.
</div>
