  The maximum number of concurrent builds that Jenkins may perform on this
  agent.
  <p>
  A good value to start with would be the number of CPU cores on the machine.
  Setting a higher value would cause each build to take longer, but could
  increase the overall throughput. For example, one build might be CPU-bound,
  while a second build running at the same time might be I/O-bound &mdash; so
  the second build could take advantage of the spare I/O capacity at that
  moment.
  <p>
  Agents must have at least one executor. To temporarily prevent any builds from
  being executed on an agent, use the <i>Mark this node temporarily offline</i>
  button on the agent's page.
  <p>
  This does not apply to the Jenkins master &mdash; setting the number of
  executors to zero will prevent any builds from being executed on the master.
