<div>
  Name that uniquely identifies an agent within this Jenkins installation.
  <p>
  This does not have to be the same as the agent hostname (where applicable),
  but it is often convenient to make them the same.
  <p>
  The name may not contain any characters from this list:
  <tt>?*/\%!@#$^&amp;|&lt;&gt;[]:;</tt>
  <!-- See jenkins.model.Jenkins#checkGoodName -->
